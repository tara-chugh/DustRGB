# Instructions for running the code: 
## Make the 3D L*a*b* color space plot
Run the LAB_3d_Plot.py file (with 'python3 LAB_3d_Plot.py' in the command line). It will take a moment for the plot to be generated. The plot will open as an HTML file and should open in your browser.

## Run the interactive image viewer
Run the app.py file (with 'python3 app.py' in the command line). It should open up a new window with the interactive viwer in it. Fill in all the fields on the left hand column (example values are provided in the text boxes). Note that the timestamp must be within the past 24 hours UTC (this is all that the free Meteomatics API subscription allows us to query). Press 'Fetch Image' for the image to show up on the right hand panel. If you inputted any of the input fields incorrectly, an error will appear on the bottom left. Click around on different parts of the image, and see the climate interpretation of those locations on the bottom left of the window.
